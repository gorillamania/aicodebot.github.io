<h1>Why AICodeBot?</h1>
<p>We've all been there - stuck on a bug for hours, writing commit messages that make sense only to us, or just feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks. AICodeBot is here to change that. It's a command-line tool and a GitHub Action for Code Reviews that you can run right from your terminal. It's designed to automate the mundane, improve code quality, and make your coding experience more enjoyable.</p>

<h1>What AICodeBot is NOT</h1>
<p>AICodeBot is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's here to make your job easier and more fun, not to take it away. It won't take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. It's not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool or a no-code platform. Instead, AICodeBot is designed to work with existing code bases and the git-commit level, multiplying the effectiveness of capable engineers.</p>

<h1>The Future of AICodeBot</h1>
<p>We're using AICodeBot to build AICodeBot, and it's upward spiraling all the time. We're looking for contributors to help us build it out. If you're passionate about improving the software development process and want to contribute to an open-source project that's making a difference, we'd love to have you on board.</p>


<h1>How to Contribute</h1>
<p>We need your help to make AICodeBot better. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests, and more. We use GitHub issues to track all of these.</p>

<p>So, are you ready to join us on this exciting journey? Let's automate the mundane, improve code quality, and have some fun with a heart-centered approach to generative AI. Let's build AICodeBot together!</p>
